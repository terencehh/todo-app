This project is a sample Todo App with front-end done in React, back-end done in Django.
To view it, since I have no server online, you can test it in development mode.

First please ensure you installed Python3 and Node.js in your local environment.

### `Front-End Guide`
Navigate to frontend folder and run command 'npm start'.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `Back-End Guide`
Navigate to backend folder and run command 'python manage.py runserver'.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the back-end server.

After running both front-end and back-end servers, the todo app will be functional. 
Front-end makes request to back end. Back-end stores and updates the list in database.
